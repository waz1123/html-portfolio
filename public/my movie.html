<h3>Demon Imperor</h3>

As the book was coveted by many, he was targeted by experts and was even betrayed by his student. This book allowed him to defy common sense and gain power like no other.

    Zhuo Yi-Fan decided to blow himself up including his soul along with the Nine Serenities Secret Scriptures, but he actually used one of the Nine Serenities Secret Scriptures techniques to separate his soul and possess the body of a boy owned by a Clan servant of the Luo Clan named Zhuo Fan 5000 years later.
    
    Three days before Zhuo Fan’s death, the Luo Clan was almost annihilated when the Black-Wind Mountain Bandits massacred the whole manor.
    
    Zhuo Fan, along with some guards were escorting the fleeing Luo Yun-Chang And Luo Yun-Hai , only to find his death at the hands of the pursuers.
    
    In his final moments he was filled with an obsession. It was this that drew the drifting Demonic Emperor Zhuo Yi-Fan’s resentment and allowed Zhuo Yi-Fan to possess him.
    
    Before being possessed, Zhuo Fan was a devoted servant of Luo Yun-Chang, She was very kind to him so the original Zhou Fan pledged a life-long devotion to the Luo Clan.

It was at this point that Zhuo Yi-Fan’s hatred and Zhuo Fan’s resentment fused, possessing his soul and breathing life into his body. His resentment became a contract with Zhuo Yi-Fan turning the Heart Demon into Zhuo Yi-Fan’s shackles, forcing him to protect the Luo Clan or the Heart Demon would haunt him.
    
    His goals are to surpass his past life’s cultivation realm and take vengeance against the Sacred Saint and seven Emperors of the Sacred Domain.
    
    He is also aiming to transform the Luo Clan from a third class Clan into a first class Clan and make it the eighth Clan of the Great Clans. At first he sees the Luo Clan as a hindrance, but soon starts to appreciate them and considers them as the Clan he never had in his previous life.</p>
